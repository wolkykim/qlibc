Installing qLibc
================

qLibc supports POSIX-compliant operating systems, including Linux, MacOS X and most of Unix systems. Windows OS is supported with most of features.

## Configure

### Linux and most of Unix systems.

Run "configure" command.

```
$ ./configure
```

By default qLibc will be installed in `/usr/local/{include,lib}`, so use `--prefix` option if you want to change the installation path:

```
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/qlibc
```

For those who don't want to build the extension library `libqlibcext`:

```
$ ./configure --disable-ext
```

For those who want HTTPS support in `qhttpclient` extension:

```
$ ./configure --with-openssl
```

To see detailed configure options, use `--help` option:

```
$ ./configure --help
```

### All systems

Run the "cmake" command.

```
$ cmake .
```

In many systems, CMake needs to be installed separately. qlibc requires CMake version 2.8.12 or above.
Currently, we're focusing on getting the library compiled on those machines using cmake thus it doesn't provide the full configure options as we provide in configure command.

## Compile

Run `make` in your terminal to compile the source code:

```
$ make
```

## Install

This command will install `qLibc` on your system. By default, the directory prefix is "/usr/local" so header files will be installed into `/usr/local/include` and library files will be installed into `/usr/local/lib`:

```
$ make install
```

This will only install header files and library(archive; static and dynamic) files. The document files in the "doc" directory will not be installed, so please make a copy of it by yourself if you want to keep it in the system.

## Uninstall

`qLibc` can be completely removed from the system.

```
$ make uninstall
```

## Examples and Unit Tests.

Analyzing the example code is probably a best starting point to being familiar with qlibc, but please note that the examples were written as simply as possible just to show the sample usages.

As a reminder, example codes and API documents are provided with the package in the "examples" and "doc" directories.

### Run Examples

The examples also can be compiled by running "make" command in the "examples" directory.

```
$ cd examples
$ make
```

If you're using cmake to configure the qlibc package, it will not generate Makefile for codes in examples.

### Run Unit Tests

Currently Unit Tests cover only small portion of codes. This part is in-progress area that we're looking for contributors to enrich this area. 

Unit tests can be compiled and run as following.

```
$ cd tests
$ make
$ make test
```
