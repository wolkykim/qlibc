What's qLibc?  [![Actions Status](https://github.com/wolkykim/qlibc/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wolkykim/qlibc/actions)
=============

qLibc is currently one of the most functionally-complete, publicly-licensed
C/C++ libraries. The goal of the qLibc project is to provide a **simple and
powerful general purpose C/C++ library** that includes all kinds of containers
and general library routines. It provides a ready-made set of common container
APIs with a consistent API look.

## Consistent API Look

All container APIs have a consistent look and feel. It basically provides
a creator function which usually returns a pointer to a container structure.
Also, **all functions related to the container can be accessed through function
pointers inside of the container** or traditional style direct access APIs.
For an example, 

So, regardless of which container you use, you can simply put elements into
a list with `container->put(container, ...)` or you can call them using
direct API like qtreetbl_pub(container, ...).

An examples below illustrates how it looks like.

~~~{.c}
  // create a hash-table.
  qhashtbl_t *tbl = qhashtbl(0, QHASHTBL_THREADSAFE);
  
  // add an element which key name is "score".
  int x = 12345;
  tbl->put(tbl, "score", &x, sizeof(int));
  
  // get the value of the element.
  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, "score", NULL, true);
  if(px != NULL) {
    printf("%d\n", *px);
    free(px);
  }
  
  // release table
  tbl->free(tbl);
~~~

Here is an identical implementation with a Linked-List-Table container.
You may notice that there aren't any code changes at all, except for 1 line
in the table creation. This is why qLibc encapsulates corresponding function
pointers inside of the container object.

~~~{.c}
  // create a linked-list-table. THE ONLY LINE YOU NEED TO CHANGE.
  qlisttbl_t *tbl = qlisttbl(QLISTTBL_THREADSAFE);
  
  // add an element which key name is "score".
  int x = 12345;
  tbl->put(tbl, "score", &x, sizeof(int));
  
  // get the value of the element.
  int *px = tbl->get(tbl, "score", NULL, true);
  if(px != NULL) {
    printf("%d\n", *px);             
    free(px);
  }
  
  // release table
  tbl->free(tbl);
~~~

## Looking for people to work with.

We're looking for people who want to work together to develop and improve qLibc.
Currently, we have high demands on following areas.

* Automated testing
* Documentation.
* New feature implementation.
